AI Background Remover - Installation & Setup Guide
==================================================

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to clone, install, and run the AI Background Remover project from GitHub.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A powerful web application that uses AI to automatically remove backgrounds from images.
Built with FastAPI (Python backend) and HTML/CSS/JavaScript (frontend).

Features:
- AI-powered background removal using rembg library
- Drag-and-drop interface
- Side-by-side image comparison
- Fast processing with FastAPI
- Clean, modern UI

PREREQUISITES
-------------
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

INSTALLATION FROM GITHUB
-----------------------

### Method 1: Direct Git Clone (Recommended)

1. Open Command Prompt/Terminal
2. Navigate to your desired project directory:
   ```bash
   cd "C:\path\to\your\projects"
   ```

3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mdjoherul50/bg_remover_project.git
   ```

4. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd bg_remover_project
   ```

### Method 2: Download ZIP Archive

1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click "Code" ‚Üí "Download ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location
4. Open Command Prompt/Terminal and navigate to the extracted folder

SETUP & INSTALLATION
-------------------

### Step 1: Create Virtual Environment

**Windows:**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
py -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see "(venv)" at the beginning of your command prompt.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- FastAPI (web framework)
- uvicorn (ASGI server)
- rembg (AI background removal)
- Pillow (image processing)
- python-multipart (file uploads)
- onnxruntime (ML model support)

RUNNING THE APPLICATION
----------------------

### Option 1: Local Development (Recommended for Development)

#### Step 1: Start the Backend Server

```bash
# Start the FastAPI server with auto-reload
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

You should see output like:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

#### Step 2: Open the Application

1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8000
3. The application will load with the main interface

### Option 2: Live Deployment

The application is also deployed and available online at:
**üåê https://bg-remover-project.onrender.com/**

You can use the live version directly without any installation:
- No setup required
- Works on any device with internet access
- Always up-to-date with the latest features

USING THE APPLICATION
--------------------

1. **Upload Image:**
   - Drag and drop an image onto the upload area
   - OR click the upload area to select a file from your computer

2. **Processing:**
   - Wait a few seconds for AI processing
   - You'll see a loading spinner during processing

3. **View Results:**
   - See side-by-side comparison (original vs processed image)
   - The processed image will have the background removed

4. **Download:**
   - Click "Download Image" to save the result as PNG
   - Click "Upload New" to process another image

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------

### Common Issues:

1. **"Python not found" error:**
   - Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
   - Check if Python is added to your system PATH

2. **"Module not found" errors:**
   - Make sure virtual environment is activated
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

3. **Port 8000 already in use:**
   - Close other applications using port 8000
   - OR use a different port: `uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001`

4. **Background removal not working:**
   - Ensure you have a stable internet connection (downloads ML model on first use)
   - Try with a different image format (PNG, JPG, JPEG supported)

5. **Virtual environment not activating:**
   - Windows: Use `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: Use `source venv/bin/activate`

### Performance Tips:

- First run may be slow as it downloads the AI model
- Use images under 10MB for best performance
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP

### Development Mode:

The `--reload` flag automatically restarts the server when you make code changes.
Keep the terminal running while developing.

### Production Deployment:

For production use, consider:
- Using a production WSGI server like Gunicorn
- Setting up a reverse proxy (nginx)
- Using environment variables for configuration

SUPPORT
-------

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Ensure all prerequisites are met
3. Try restarting the server
4. Check the terminal for error messages
